1. Number guessing game in python.

The rules of this game:

The hints will be like these:
Your guess was low! enter again 
Your guess was high! enter again
With the help of these hints, you should get to the random number chosen by the computer.
when you get the right number, you will get an output like this:
You guessed it right! congrats + a score detailing the number of attempts.
